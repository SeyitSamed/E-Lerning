# E-Lerning
Hello, I'm Seyit. I am studying "Computer Education and Instructional Technology" at Yıldız Technical University. I'm in my 4th grade now.
In this repository, there are projects that I have done in the field of e-learning so far. My projects are mostly aimed at middle school and high school students.
